# Library

This is a simple web application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can add new books, sort the books based on different criteria, and mark books as read or unread.

## Features

- **Add Book**: Users can click on the "ADD BOOK" button in the header to open a form where they can enter the details of a new book, including the title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read it or not. Upon submitting the form, the book will be added to the library.
- **Empty Library**: Clicking on the "Empty library" button in the "library-buttons" section will remove all books from the library.
- **Sort Books**: Users can select a sorting option and click the "Sort" button to rearrange the books in the library based on the selected criteria. The available sorting options include sorting by title (A to Z or Z to A), author (A to Z or Z to A), number of pages (minimum to maximum or maximum to minimum), and read status (read first or not read first).
- **Book Display**: The main section of the web page contains a "library" where the books will be displayed. Each book entry will show the title, author, number of pages, and a checkbox indicating whether the book has been read or not.
